# Introduction
The number system is a form of expressing numbers. Different number systems are used in electronics and digital system. Number system represents the value of a number with respect to its given base. There are four types of the number systems namely decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal number system. This project reduces the time for calculating the number system conversion without doing manually. This project converts one type of number system to another type of number system.
# Features
In computer system architecture, number systems are a technique for representing numbers. This project works with the conversion of decimal number system to any other number system and binary number system to any other number system for any positive value input.

Number System  | Description
-------------- |------------
Decimal Number System | The decimal number system is the one we use on a daily basis, and it uses digits ranging from 0 to 9, i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Because the entire number allowed in this number system is 10, the decimal number system's base number is 10. Any number that is represented without a base has a base of 10.
Binary Number System  | The binary number system is made up of two numerals: one and zero. The base of this number system is 2 because it only contains two numbers. Electronic and computer-based devices, networking, and digital signal processing all employ this number system.
Octal Number System | The octal number system is a number system with an eight-digit base with digits ranging from 0 to 7. The term octal is used to describe numbers with an eight-digit base. Octal numbers have a wide range of applications and significance, including use in computers and digital numbering systems.
Hexadecimal Number System | The word hexadecimal can be divided into 'Hexa' and 'deci', where 'Hexa' means 6 and 'deci' means 10. The hexadecimal number system is a 16-digit representation of numerals 0 through 9 and digits A through F. To put it another way, the first nine numbers or digits are represented as integers, while the next six digits are represented as symbols ranging from A to F. After nine digits, the tenth digit is represented by a symbol: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Because each digit has a weight of power 16, the hexadecimal number system is also known as a positional number system.
