# Introduction
Different number systems are used in electronics and digital system. There are four types of the number systems namely decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal number system. The base of the number system is the total number of the digit used in number system. This project reduces the time for calculating the number system conversion without doing manually. This project converts one type of number system to another type of number system.
## 1. Decimal Number System
* Uses ten digits from 0 to 9
* Also called base 10 number system
## 2. Binary Number System
* Uses two digits that are 0 and 1
* Also called base 2 number system
## 3. Octal Number System
* Uses eight digits from 0 to 7
* Also called base 8 number system
## 4. Hexadecimal Number System
* Uses ten digits and six letters that are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
* Also called base 10 number system
* Letters represent A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
# Feature
This project works with the conversion of decimal number system to any other number system and binary number system to any other number system
