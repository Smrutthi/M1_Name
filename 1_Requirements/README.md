# Introduction
The number system is a form of expressing numbers. Different number systems are used in electronics and digital system. Number system represents the value of a number with respect to its given base. There are four types of the number systems namely decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal number system. This project reduces the time for calculating the number system conversion without doing manually. This project converts one type of number system to another type of number system.
## 1. Decimal Number System
* Uses ten digits from 0 to 9
* Also called base 10 number system
## 2. Binary Number System
* Uses two digits that are 0 and 1
* Also called base 2 number system
* Used in digital systems
## 3. Octal Number System
* Uses eight digits from 0 to 7
* Also called base 8 number system
* Used in computer application sectors
## 4. Hexadecimal Number System
* Uses ten digits and six letters that are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
* Also called base 10 number system
* Letters represent A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
* Used in microprocessor and microcontroller
