# NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERSION
## Introduction
The number system is a form of expressing numbers. Different number systems are used in electronics and digital system. Number system represents the value of a number with respect to its given base. There are four types of the number systems namely decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal number system. This project reduces the time for calculating the number system conversion without doing manually. This project converts one type of number system to another type of number system.

## 1. Decimal Number System
* Uses ten digits from 0 to 9
* Also called base 10 number system
* Used in number calculations
## 2. Binary Number System
* Uses two digits that are 0 and 1
* Also called base 2 number system
* Used in digital systems
## 3. Octal Number System
* Uses eight digits from 0 to 7
* Also called base 8 number system
* Used in computer application sectors
## 4. Hexadecimal Number System
* Uses ten digits and six letters that are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
* Also called base 10 number system
* Letters represent A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
* Used in microprocessor and microcontroller systems
## Features
In computer system architecture, number systems are a technique for representing numbers. This project works with the conversion of decimal number system to any other number system and binary number system to any other number system for any positive value input.

## Architecture
* Structural Diagram
* Behavioral Diagram
## 1. Structural Diagram
Structural diagrams are a type of visual design that depicts the stages required to solve a problem. The structural diagram depicts the hierarchy or structure of the system's many components or modules, as well as how they connect and interact with one another.

## 2. Behavioral Diagram
Behavior diagrams depict the items in a system's dynamic behavior which can be represnted as a series of changes over time. A behavior diagram is intended to provide clarity.
